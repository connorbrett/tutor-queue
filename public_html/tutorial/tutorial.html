            <h4>At the tutor center, the students can ask for help with their
                assignments/projects from the tutors. Conventionally, the student queue
                is managed by hundreds of Google Sheets rows which makes it slow
                and unorganized. Thus, this website is created to make
                the process faster, organized, and more convinient.
                <br><br>
                Below are some dummy accounts for testing purpose:<br>

                + Coordinator: <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;username: coord1@email.arizona.edu<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;passowrd: abc123

                The average waiting time is 7 minutes or more depends on the number of waiting students in
                the queue so please be patient while you are waiting, thank you!
